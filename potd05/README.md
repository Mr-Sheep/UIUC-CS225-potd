The Problem
Create a program using a new class you create!

Write a Student class that has two private member variables: name_ and grade_
This class should reside in the potd namespace.
Write the functions get_name, set_name, etc. to access those private member variables.
Write the default constructor.
Write the function graduate that is not part of the class (in q6.cpp) which increases the grade of a Student by one. This function must be called by passing a Student object by reference. Put it in the default namespace.
In main.cpp write a main function that creates an instance of the Student class, prints out the grade, calls graduate on it, and prints out the new grade.
Sample Output
There are many correct outputs, one correct output is the following:

Sally is in grade 5.
Sally is in grade 6.
Graded files
The only files that will be submitted for grading on this problem is student.cpp,student.h,q6.cpp,q6.h
