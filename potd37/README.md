# The Story

Today the students and TA's have flipped roles! We wrote some functions, and you have to tell us if they are good or if they have bugs.

# The Problem

You will have to come up with test cases for seven given functions which we describe below. You can run the code locally as many times as you want passing as many arguments as you would like into our functions. The actual code that you will be submitting is in the `potd.cpp` file. In this file there is a function called evaluate. All that this function should do is return a vector of integers. Vector index i should be 0 if the ith function is has a bug and 1 if the function is correct.

The functions' behavior is outlined in the `Functions.h` file. Note that it is "proper behavior" if our functions print out an error message and exit because the input to the function was outside of the range specified in the specs (listed in the `Functions.h` file).

# Important

As there are only 7 functions, and we want to prevent guessing and checking, you will only get 3 **submissions** for this potd. After that, you will no longer be able to submit.

Go forth and test!

# Graded files

The only files that will be submitted for grading on this problem is `potd.cpp`
