The Problem
Complete the sortList function that accepts a Node \*\* (the head of a linked list, passed by pointer). This function must sort the linked list without allocating any nodes and without changing what's in the data\_ member variables. In other words, you are to sort the list only by manipulating the pointers.

This sort does not need to be the most efficient sort possible, it just needs to be correct. A main function has been provided that exercises your sortList function.

Hint: if you are getting stuck, draw a detailed memory diagram.

Understanding Node**
If you do not understand why a Node** is being passed in, read the following:

A Node \*_ is a Node _ passed by pointer. What would happen if we just normally passed a Node _head representing the head of the linked list into the function? We could still alter the node that head points to. But what if we want to change the head pointer itself? E.g., what if we wanted to insert a new node into the front of the list? If we just called the function like this: insertSorted(head, node) where head is a Node _, then the memory address stored in the pointer is copied into the function. The function can change the pointer, but this will only change the copy of the pointer, not the pointer that lives outside the function. To change the address stored in the pointer we need to pass by pointer. The function call would then look like: insertNode(&head, node). We also could have passed the pointer by reference, though we would have to change the function signature to be: insertSorted(Node _ & head, Node _ n).
