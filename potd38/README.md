# The Files

Here's a brief description of the files you've been given:

- `spring.h:` Declares the spring function that you will implement
- `spring.cpp`: Put your code in here.
- `main.cpp`: A driver file to run your function and print its result.
- `Makefile`: Compiles your code for you.

# The Problem

You will be completing a program that tells us what you are doing for spring break to `stdout`. All the code you write will go in `spring.cpp`

# TODO:

- Write a function `spring` that takes no arguments and returns a `std::string` that tells what you are doing on Spring Break.

# Testing Your Code

Run the following commands to compile and execute your code:

```
make
./main
```

# Sample Output

I caught up on sleep.

# Graded files

The only files that will be submitted for grading on this problem is **spring.cpp**
