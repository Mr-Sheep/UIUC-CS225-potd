# The Problem

In `potd.h`, write a templated function `fewer` which takes in two variables of the same type and returns whichever variable is fewer than (`<`) the other.

You will also need to updatethe `Food` class in order for `fewer` to be able to be called properly.

# Expected Output

```
We have fewer apples.
```

# Graded files

The only files that will be submitted for grading on this problem is `food.cpp`, `potd.h`
