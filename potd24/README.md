# The Problem

Create a class `Queue`.

Implement the following member functions of the queue class:

- `int getSize()` - returns the number of elements in the queue (0 if empty)
- `bool isEmpty()` - returns if the list has no elements, else false
- `void enqueue()` - puts an item to the queue in O(1) time
- `int dequeue()` - removes an item off the queue and returns the value in O(1) time

We will not test Rule of Three methods, but we will call the destructor.

# Graded files

The only files that will be submitted for grading on this problem is `Queue.cpp`, `Queue.h`
