The Problem
Write two constructors for the pet class that we have defined for you. The given files Pet.cpp and Pet.h contain all of the code needed for the class except the constructors. One constructor should be the default constructor (how many arguments should it have?) and will assign the member variables the following values:

name: Rover
birth_year: 2018
type: dog
owner_name: Wade
The other constructor should take in the name, birth year, type, and owner of the pet as arguments and set the member variables accordingly.

Testing Your Code
Run the following commands to compile and execute your code:

make
./main
Sample Output
Name: Rover
Birth year: 2018
Type: dog
Owner: Wade
Graded files
The only files that will be submitted for grading on this problem is Pet.cpp,Pet.h
