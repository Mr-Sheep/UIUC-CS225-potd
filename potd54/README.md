# The Problem

Given a `pattern` and a string `str`, find if `str` follows the same pattern.

Here follows means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a non-empty word in `str`. You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and `str` contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.

# Example Output:

```
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
```
