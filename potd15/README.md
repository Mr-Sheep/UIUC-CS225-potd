# #The Problem

Complete the function `stringList` that accepts a `Node *` (the head of a linked list) as a parameter and creates a `string` out the list in the following format:

Node 0: 100 -> Node 1: 200 -> Node 2: 300
If the list is empty then the function should return `"Empty list"`.

# Testing Your Code

This time we do not provide you with local test cases. You should write your own test cases. In `main.cpp`, you should test your `stringList` in, at least, the following cases:

- An empty list
- A list with exactly one node
- A list with more than one node (eg: 100 -> 200 -> 300, as shown above)
  We will not be checking your `main` function.

# Graded files

The only files that will be submitted for grading on this problem is `potd.cpp`
