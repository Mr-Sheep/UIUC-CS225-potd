# The Problem

Write a function `vector<int> *genPrimes(int M)` that returns a pointer to a vector of prime numbers from 2 to `M`.

There are several algorithms to do this, but the Sieve of Eranthoses is the most common one.

There is a `main.cpp` that tests this. Sample run:

```
The 3rd prime is 5
The 100th prime is 541
The largest prime below 1000 is 997
```
