The Problem
Overload the + and = operators for the Square class we have provided you.

The = should make a deep copy of the Square object.
The + operator should concatenate the names of the two Squares and add their lengths.
We've included a main.cpp with some sample code to test these. The expected output is

Square a mysquare 2
Square b mysquare 2
Square c mysquaremysquare 4
