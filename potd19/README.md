# The Problem

Complete the function isValid that checks if a string has valid brackets.

The function `isValid` takes a string as input, which may contain three kinds of brackets: `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, `']'`. A valid input should not contain any unmatched, extra or hanging brackets of any kind. And they must close in the correct order. Your function should ignore any characters other than these three types of brackets.

# Example

```
"()[]{}!" // valid
"([cs225)]" // invalid
```

Testing Your Code
A `main.cpp` has been provided to you with very limited test cases. You are encouraged to add your own!

# Motivation

Can I also solve this problem without using a stack as well?
Yes! We encourage you to think of different solutions and compare them in terms of time, space complexity and code elegancy. If you come up with an algorithm that does not require a stack, feel free to share it on Piazza with your peers! (general algorithm, not your code)
