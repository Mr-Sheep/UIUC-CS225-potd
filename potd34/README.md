# The Problem

Complete the function `find` in `BTreeNode.cpp` that accepts a `BTreeNode *` and an `int val`, and must return the `BTreeNode *` that contains the matching `val`, or `NULL` if `val` was not found.

# Example:

In `main.cpp`, an exmaple BTree has been provided to help you test your code:

```
find:
val = 30

            [30    60]
          /      |     \
      [10 20]  [40 50]  [70 80]
Expected Output
Yes :) In Node    30 60
```

The only files that will be submitted for grading on this problem is `BTreeNode.cpp`,`BTreeNode.h`
