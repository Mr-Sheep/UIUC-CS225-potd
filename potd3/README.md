The Problem
Explore the different ways of passing variables to functions by writing three functions that print out the passed variable memory address. Complete three functions in q4.cpp:

pass_by_value, passing a Circle class by value
pass_by_pointer, passing a Circle class by pointer
pass_by_ref, passing a Circle class by reference
You will also need to write their prototypes in q4.h.

Each of these functions are already called in main. You should look at how they are used to set up your function correctly. In every function, the Circle should be passed as the variable c.

A Makefile has been provided for you, which will make main. Once your program prints out all four memory addresses, ensure the memory addresses printed out are what you expect (eg: which ones are the same?).
