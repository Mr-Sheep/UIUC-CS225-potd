# The Problem

Complete the `getHeightBalance` function that accepts a BST `TreeNode *` root and returns the "height balance" of the tree. Here, the "height balance" of a tree is simply the height of its left-subtree minus the height of its right sub-tree. The "height balance" of an empty tree is 0.

_HINT: It may be helpful to have a helper function for computing height._

# Testing Your Code

In `main.cpp`, a simple test case has been created with a simple binary search tree:

```
     8
    /  \
   5    13
       /  \
      10  14
       \
       11
        \
        12
```

The only files that will be submitted for grading on this problem is `TreeNode.cpp`,`TreeNode.h`
