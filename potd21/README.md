# The Problem

Complete the `listIntersection` function that accepts two `Node *` (the heads of two linked lists) and returns a `Node *` that points to the head of a new linked list. This function must create a new list (containing new nodes, allocated on the heap) that contains the set intersection of the values in both lists.

For example:

```
List 1: 0 1 2
List 2: 2 3 4
Intersection: 2
List 1: 0 2 2 2
List 2: 0 0 0 4
Intersection: 0
```

The order of nodes in your new list does not matter, only that it is a proper set intersection. A main function has been provided that exercises your listIntersection function.
