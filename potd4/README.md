The Problem
Create a program using a new class you create!

First, write a Food class:

Write a class Food that has two private member variables: name_ and quantity_.
Write the functions to access those private member variables. Call them get_name, set_name, get_quantity, and set_quantity.
Write the default constructor.
Now, work on a simple q5.cpp:

Write a function increase_quantity in q5.cpp (not part of the class Food) which increases the quantity of a food by one.
This function should be called by passing a Food object by pointer.
Finally, in main.cpp, write your main function:

Creates an instance of the Food class:
print out the quantity of food,
call increase_quantity on it, and
print out the new quantity
Sample Output
There are many correct outputs, one correct output is the following:

You have 5 apples.
